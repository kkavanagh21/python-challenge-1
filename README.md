Project Title: Katie’s Variety Food Truck Ordering System

Technologies Used: Python, VS Code

Project Overview:
I developed a comprehensive ordering system for a food truck using VS Code and implemented it in Python. This project showcases my ability to manage user input, handle complex data structures, and perform real-time calculations effectively.

Key Features:
•	Dynamic Menu Interaction: I built an interface that enables users to navigate through a hierarchical menu stored in nested dictionaries, demonstrating a deep understanding of data structures.
•	User Input Handling: I implemented robust input validation to ensure the system effectively handles user errors, such as non-numeric inputs or invalid choices, enhancing the user experience and system reliability.
•	Order Management: I designed a loop-based ordering process that supports multiple item selections and quantities, providing immediate feedback and allowing for order review or modifications before final submission.
•	Financial Calculations: I integrated functionality to calculate the total cost of an order in real-time by multiplying item prices by quantities and summing up the results, showcasing my competence in arithmetic operations within software applications.

Professional Skills Demonstrated:
•	Problem Solving: I addressed the challenge of structuring a user-friendly ordering process based on complex menu data.
•	Software Development Fundamentals: I applied core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, data structures (lists and dictionaries), and functions.
•	Attention to Detail: I ensured accurate financial calculations and clear, error-free user communications.
•	User-Centric Design: I focused on creating an intuitive and error-resistant interface that accommodates various user inputs and scenarios.

This project highlights my technical skills in programming and underscores my ability to design user-centered software solutions, making me an excellent candidate for roles in educational technology where developing engaging and effective learning tools is essential.
